# My Passwords

### Overview

A web app that allows you to generate a safe and secure password of any length of your choice and gives you the ability to save them online in a bucket list.

### Motivation

I absolutely want to continue adding new features. I love this project; it inspires me and makes me feel secure knowing that I don't have to always remember my passwords.

### Technologies Used

I didn't use too many technologies. It's very simple and open for you to use or even add additional features.

### Installation

To get started, simply run:

```bash
npm install
```

And there you are! ðŸ‘Œ
